    "\n",
    "### What the pipeline above is doing\n",
    "1. Firstly we are building the training graph for an era, here we use only the collaborations that occured up to the era's cutoff year. This gives us a graph G_train that will have the nodes which will be the artists known by that time, and the edges which will be the collaborations before the cutoff year.\n",
    "2. It then helps us identify the future collaborations (positives), basically these are the artists that in the next time window (the test period), actually collaborated in reality. These are what we try to predict\n",
    "3. We then sample the negative (non-edge) examples, where we randomly select the sample pairs of artists (u, v) that existed in the train graph, but did not collaborate in the train graph and are not connected in the test set either. These serve as the non-collaborations. This follows the standard method in Liben-Nowell & Kleinberg (2007). We match the number of positive examples so the dataset is balanced.\n",
    "4. We then compute the 4 link-prediction scores, where for every positive and negative pair we have: Common Neighbors, Jaccard Coefficient, Adamic-Adar, Preferential Attachment. These scores tell us how strongly the graph structure suggests a link between the two artists. This step is the actual prediction part, meaning there is no training or machine learning model here but structural link prediction uses graph topology directly.\n",
    "5. We then combine the scores and labels into one data frame, where for each pair, we get all the stuff in the dataframe as we can see above. This dataframe is the final output of the pipeline. We save it separately for Eras 1-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the evaluation phase will look like now\n",
    "1. First step will be loading the score datafram for each era wehre each row represents a predicted vs non-predicted collaboration\n",
    "2. It also computes the evaluation metrics, such as AUC, Precision, Recall, Hits, Average Precision, these metrics will tell us how well the structural scores separate real future edges from non-edges\n",
    "3. Compare methods by determining which structural mechanism is strongest, like is it the triadic closure or homophily/Jaccard or PA?\n",
    "4. We will visualize the findings like all the curves and score distributions and Gephi with diff features\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simpler way to put everything, calculate the scores for 2 artists who don't collaborate in the train, and then look at their actual score in the test set, then compare that with the fact of whether they actually collaborate in the future or not, then compare which indicator or score actually makes more sense on future collaborations.\n",
